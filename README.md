# Bootstrapped Control Limits for Score-Based Concept Drift Detection

This repository provides a **reproducible implementation** of the control-limit calibration method proposed in the accompanying manuscript  
**“Control Limits for Concept Drift Detection Based on Score Vectors and Bootstrap Estimation” (blinded)**.

The implementation reproduces key empirical results from the paper — specifically, the **score-based MEWMA chart** with **nested bootstrap control limits** and **0.632-style correction** on two representative examples:
1. **Linear mixture model** (ridge regression scores)
2. **Nonlinear oscillator** (neural network last-layer scores)

Both examples can be reproduced with a single command.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Reproduce a Key Figure)

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. Run the main example (linear mixture)

```bash
bash scripts/reproduce_linear.sh
```

This script:

* Generates synthetic data (Eqs. 4.1–4.2)
* Fits the baseline ridge model and extracts score vectors
* Computes **time-varying bootstrap control limits**
* Streams post-shift data and produces a **T² vs. UCL plot**

Output is saved in:

```
outputs/mixture/t2_vs_ucl.png
```

You should immediately recognize the figure reproduced from the paper (similar to Figure 2).

## 🧩 Python API Example

```python
from driftcl.bootstrap_cl import compute_control_limits
from driftcl.monitoring import monitor_stream
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

# Step 1: fit model and compute bootstrap-based control limits
cl = compute_control_limits(
    X_train, y_train,
    model=Ridge(alpha=0.1),
    alpha=1e-3, lambda_=0.01,
    BO=60, BI=120, epsilon_reg=1e-6
)

# Step 2: monitor streaming data
results = monitor_stream(X_stream, y_stream, fitted_model, cl, lambda_=0.01)
```

`results` includes:

* `z_i`: MEWMA vectors
* `T2_i`: test statistics
* `CL_i`: time-varying control limits
* `signal_index`: first detection time (if any)

## 📦 Supplementary Archive for Review

A single blinded archive can be created via:

```bash
bash scripts/make_supplement.tar.sh
```

This produces:

```
supplement_for_review.tar.gz
```

containing:

* Minimal source code
* `run.sh` (one-command reproduction)
* Output figure and CSV table
* Short README.txt

This ensures compliance with *Technometrics* reproducibility policy:

> “Source a file without modification, wait, and immediately recognize an important figure summarizing results of a challenging example.”
